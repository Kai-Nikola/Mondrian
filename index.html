      <h1>Piet Mondrian</h1>
      <p>
        Piet Mondrian was a Dutch painter born on March 7, 1872, in Amersfoort, Netherlands. and art theorist, a pioneer
        of abstract art. His work is characterized by
        simple, geometric shapes like rectangles and lines, primarily in black, white, gray, and primary colors.
        Mondrian sought to express universal harmony and balance through his art, a philosophy he termed
        "Neoplasticism." His iconic style influenced countless artists and designers, making him a foundational figure
        in modern art.

        Mondrian's art was highly utopian and was concerned with a search for universal values and aesthetics. He
        proclaimed in 1914: "Art is higher than reality and has no direct relation to reality. To approach the spiritual
        in art, one will make as little use as possible of reality, because reality is opposed to the spiritual.
